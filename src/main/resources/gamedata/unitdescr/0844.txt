A Niefel Giant is a frost giant descended from the old Rimtursar. They have sprung from the glaciers of Niefelheim, the Land of Eternal Frost. Niefel Giants are constantly surrounded by an icy wind and their bodies temper and strengthen in cold lands. They are led by ancient Jarls skilled in the use of the magics of frost and Death. All Niefel Giants are sacred to the Jotuns.
